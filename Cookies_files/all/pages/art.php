		Art of Grangegorman

		Drawing from the Grangegorman Arts Strategy (2012), ‘…the lives we live’1 Grangegorman Public Art programme
		 was launched in September 2015. It is designed to be comprehensive and consists of six diverse but complementary
		 art pathways. The core vision of the Arts Strategy is to connect ambitious art and artists with Grangegorman’s past
		 and futures in ways which meaningfully contribute to the cultures and sub-cultures at play. The aim of the Grangegorman Public
		 Art programme is to support the ongoing commissioning of artworks which have the imaginative potential to address the
		 possibilities of this context and which build a legacy into the future.
